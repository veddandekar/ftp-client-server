# FTP Client-Server

Project to implement both - a FTP client and a server from scratch in Python.

The main objective of this project is self learning and as such the main focus here is on feature implementation.

----

## **Usage**

### Server
execute the following command
```
sudo python3 server.py (IP_Here) (port)

```
**Note:**
- If no port is given, 21 is used.
- If neither port nor IP is given, user will be explicitly asked.



### Client
execute the following command
```
python3 client.py (IPHere) (port)

```
**Note:**
- If no port is given, 21 is used.
- If neither port nor IP is given, FTP starts without a connection.
